# Getting started

You will need to get an API token from the [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) in order to use this bot.

Once installed, you will need to add a running bot as an administrator to any super-groups you want to protect with the Telegram client.

Attention! The Hide Members feature must be disabled to work properly!

Please check out the [list of available bot actions](available-bot-actions.md) before using this bot.

You can also [change bot's settings](schema-documentation.md) by editing the `%APPDATA%\ecasbot\ecasbot.json` file in any text editor.

Don't forget to restart the bot after doing any changes to this file.
